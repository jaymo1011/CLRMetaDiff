# CLRMetaDiff, a diff viewer for CLR assemblies!
CLRMetaDiff (**C**ommon **L**anguage **R**untime **Meta**data **Diff**erence) is a tool to compare the differences between versions CLR assemblies.

The tool compares changes between the types and type members contained within two assemblies or two directories with matching named assembilies.

*It was also made very quickly for a one time use and probably won't be updated...*

## Usage
`CLRMetaDiff.exe [original-file-or-dir] [changed-file-or-dir]`

Note: you can only compare files to other files or directories to other directories, not both!
